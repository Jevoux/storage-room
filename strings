# Strings
# Strings are sequences of Unicode characters.
# We can use single or double quotes to
# represent strings. Multiline strings are
# denotes with triple quotes ''' or """.

a = "This is a string"
print(a)

b = '''This one is a huge multiline 
string that does not fit in a 
single line'''
print(b)

# Like in a list or in a tuple, the slicing
# operator can be used with strings. Strings
# are immutable.

c = 'Hello world!'

print("c[4] = ", c[4])

# c[6:11] = 'world'
print("c[6:11] = ", c[6:11])

# Will generate an error.
# Strings are immutable.
