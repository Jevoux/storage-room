# Sets
# A set is an unordered collection of unique
# items. A set is defined by {braces} and 
# separated by commas.

a = {5, 2, 3, 1, 4}

# printing set variable
print("a = ", a)

# data type of variable a
print(type(a))

# We can perform operations like union and
# intersection on two sets. Sets have unique
# values, eliminating duplicates.
b = {1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3}
print(b)

# Since sets are unordered, indexing has
# no meaning.
b[1]
