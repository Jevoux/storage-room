# Data types (numbers)
# There are integers, floating point and
# complex numbers.
# Integers are defined by the int() class.
# Floats are defined by the float() class.
# Complex numbers are defined by the
# complex class.

# Integers can be of any length, only limited
# by the memory available.
a = 1234567890123456789
print(a)

# Floating point numbers are accurate up to
# 15 decimals.
b = 0.1234567890123456789
print(b)
# The floating variable gets truncated.

# Complex numbers are written in the form of
# x+yj, where x is the real part and y is
# the imaginary part.
c = 1+2j
