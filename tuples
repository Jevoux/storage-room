# Tuples
# A tuple is an ordered sequence of items like
# a list, but Atuples are immutable. Tuples
# created can't be modified. They are used to
# write-protect data and are usually faster
# than a list because it cannot be changed
# dinamically. The tuple is defined with
# (parenthesis) and separated by commas.

t = (5, 'program', 1+3j)
print(t)

# We can use the slicing operator [] to
# extract items but we can't chamge its value.

# t[1] = 'program'
print("t[1] = ", t[1])

# t[0:3] = (5, 'program', (1+3j))
print("t[0:3] = ", t[0:3])

# Will generate an error.
# Tuples are immutable.
t[0] = 10
