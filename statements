# Statements
# Ststements are instructions that an
# interpreter can execute. There are
# if statements, while statements and others.

# This is an assignment statement.

# Multiline statements
# In Python, the end of a statement is marked
# by a newline character but we can make a
# statement extend over multiple lines with
# the continuation character (\).

# In Python, line continuation is implied
# inside (parenthesis), [brackets] and
# {braces}.

print(y)
# The surrounding (parenthesis) do the line
# continuation implicitly. 

# Same for [brackets] and {braces}.
