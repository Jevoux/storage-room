# Indentation
# A code of block (body of a function, loop,
# etc) starts wirh indentation and ends with
# the first unindented line. The ammount of
# indentation is up to you but it must be
# consistent in that block.
# Four whitespaces are used for indentation and
# is preferred to tabs.
# Indentation can be ignored in line
# continuation but it is good practice to
# always indent if needed to make the code
# more readable.

a = 5

if True:
    print('Hello')
    a = 5

# and

b = 5
if True:    print('Hello'); b = 5

# Both are valid but the first looks clearer.
# Incorrect indentation will result in an
# indentation error.
