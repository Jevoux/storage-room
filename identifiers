# Identifiers
# An identifier is a name given to entities
# like class, functions, variables, etc. It
# helps to differentiate one entoty from
# another.

# Rules for writing identifiers
# Identifiers csn be a combination of letters
# in lower (a-z), upper case (A-Z), digits
# (0-9) or an underscore (_).

# An identifier can't start with a digit.

# Keywords can't be used as identifiers.

# We can't use special symbols such as
# !, @, #, $, %, etc.

# Identifiers can be of any length.

#Remember:
# Python is case sensitive. Always name
# identifiers so they make sense.

# Multiple words can be separated by an
# underscore, this_is_a_long_variable.
